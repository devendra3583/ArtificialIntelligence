       PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS - Heart Disease Risk of a patient
=====================================================
Problem Statement: Given a set of features/parameters of over 4000 patients, like
1. Age
2. Education level
3. Whether current smoker or not
4. How many cigarettes the patient smokes per day?
5. Whether the patient is suffering from diabetes or not?
6. Heart Rate
7. Glucose level of the patient, etc.
Predict, whether a patient will suffer from Heart Disease or not?
The dataset is divided into 2 parts: 1. training set, and 2. testing set, 
and predictive analytics is performed on that.
The algorithm/model achieves a training accuracy score of 85.2% after data-preprocessing phase and classfication(Supervised Learning)/predictive analysis.
